# easing.bi
An easing library for FreeBASIC I wrote while working on my generative art toolkit.

Just include `#include "easing/easing.bi"`, and _voilà_

It contains all the “classics”, that is circular, cubic, exponential, linear (of course), quadratic, quintic, sine, and smooth(er)Step easing. Any feedback is welcome.
