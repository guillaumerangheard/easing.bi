# easing.bi v0.4

_easing.bi_ is an easing library for FreeBASIC I wrote while working on my generative art toolkit. To use it, just download and copy the _easing_ folder into your project, #include `"easing/easing.bi"`, and _voilà_.

It contains (almost) all of [Penner's equations](http://robertpenner.com/easing/), as well as [smooth(er)step](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep), and a port of greweb's [Bézier easing](https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing).
